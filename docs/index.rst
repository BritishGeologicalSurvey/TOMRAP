Tool for Multi-hazard Risk Assessment in Python
------------------------------------------------

The project builds on outputs from the METEOR project (NEE6423R) to generate a tool that can be used in future projects to assess multi-hazard risk. The METEOR model was initially developed in ArcGIS. By streamlining this code in Python we will make multi-hazard risk analysis faster and more widely applicable.

This software was developed from a jupyter notebook by @kle (Kathryn Leeming) to take multiple spatial inputs (dbf, tifs) and combine them to create hazard vulternability maps.

Notebook was run from a directory containing copies of the files, original files are on W drive. The original notebooks are now archived in the `notebooks` directory.
